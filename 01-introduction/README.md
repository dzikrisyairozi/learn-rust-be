# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Why Rust for Backend?

Rust is **fast**, **safe**, and **excellent** for concurrency, making it a perfect choice for backend development. By compiling to *machine code* (no garbage collector), Rust gives you both **high performance** and **memory safety**. It also reduces crashes in production thanks to its *strict compile-time checks*.

### 1.1.1 Key Advantages
- **Performance**: Rust avoids the overhead of a virtual machine, making services responsive and efficient.
- **Memory Safety**: Rust’s *ownership model* prevents null pointer issues and data races before your program runs.
- **Concurrency**: Rust helps you write multi-threaded or async code without fear of data races, ideal for modern, scalable backends.
- **Ecosystem**: With *Cargo* and a growing community, you’ll find plenty of libraries for routing, databases, and more.

## 1.2 Overview of Backend-Specific Considerations

When you build backend services, you deal with:
1. **Security**: Safeguarding data and users against vulnerabilities.
2. **Concurrency**: Handling many requests at once, requiring robust thread or async management.
3. **Performance**: Maximizing throughput and minimizing resource usage.
4. **Scalability**: Growing your service without rewriting core parts.
5. **Maintainability**: Keeping code readable, structured, and easy to update.

Rust aligns well with these needs, helping you create reliable, efficient systems.

## 1.3 Recap of Rust Basics

You should already be comfortable with:
- *Ownership & Borrowing*: Rust’s unique way of handling memory.
- *Error Handling*: Using `Result` or `Option`, and the `?` operator for clean code.
- *Modules & Crates*: Organizing code and managing dependencies with *Cargo*.

If you’re new to these, check the [learn-rust](https://github.com/dzikrisyairozi/learn-rust) repository or other Rust basics before continuing.
